Every person who earns money invests his savings in some or other instruments. For a layman, bank TDR (Term Deposit Received) is only the option. They do not invest in share market as they feel that investment is risky. But, there are certain companies who pay dividends every year consistently which is more beneficial when compared to bank interest. At the same time, the price quotations of such shares fluctuate and increase. Here, the investor gets benefit of good interest rate in the form of dividend and benefit of selling the shares at a higher rate which gets certain tax exemptions under Section 10 of Income Tax Act, 1961.

Many systems are available for Stock Market Forecasting, but these systems lack the ability to process a huge amount of data in less time.
The goal of the project is to forecast the stock market price considering the stock prices of the previous years using R programming. The data includes the stock day high, day low, open and close price. The data thus analyzed is represented on a webpage. The Shiny package in R Studio is used to build the webpage.
